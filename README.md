# Web-Scrapping-and-Automated-Email
Web scrapping and automated email project

--still needing to build the web scrapper--

the web scrapper will feed a name and email into the contacts.txt file.
then that will be read by "read_contacts.py" which will call the function from "email_sender.py" which will automatically send email. 

Im sure the code could be better, open to improvements and suggestions. This is my first attempt.
